== Startags!

Organize your github stars with own tags

Unfortunatly, I pause development and disable host. But you can use it on your own host!

= Requirements

- install Elasticsearch + redis + pg

- clone and bundle this app

- register Github app and provide GITHUB_KEY and GITHUB_SECRET global variables

- provide SECRET_KEY_BASE global var for production env

- run sidekiq (used for collecting new stars) & server
